        <h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The paper is mainly about how AR help Chinese Hip Hop to be better. The paper has three parts: rhyme, wordplay, and the theme of lyrics. AR was born in Xian, and he grow up in Guangzhou. He joined “精气神”, a Guangzhou local rap group when he was 14. In 2016, he participated in the third season of “China’s Best Songs” and won third place in the show. He was hailed by Tao as the hope of “Chinese hip-hop”. AR’s music has always unleashed a “punch”, his incisive lyrics and smooth and skillful rap are like his weapons.  He is the “principal” in the Chinese hip-hop circle. I will use some different songs AR to show AR’s contribution to rhyme, wordplay, and the criticism of Chinese Hip Hop.</p>

<h2 id="Rhyme"><a href="#Rhyme" class="headerlink" title="Rhyme"></a>Rhyme</h2><p>​    Rhyme means words that sound the same or similar in their endings. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry">Poems</a> and popular song <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics">lyrics</a> often use rhyme. There are lots of different kinds of techniques of rhyme. There are lots of fancy rhymes from AR. 《ABC》 can be a good example of rhyme. For the AR part, there are lots of words that end with rhyme. “简单如ABC(Simple like ABC). 打开我的歌像个App (Open my song like an App). 外号ACE(nickname ACE).跟你不在一个维度我们ACG(We are not in the same dimension as you ACG).” According to the lyrics, most rhyme is English. They are imperfect triple rhymes (Alim, 2003) which means part of the words is rhymed. “你们输出的只有CO2（All you’re exporting is CO2） 我是METEOR (I’m METEOR) 开个说唱艺术展在798(Open a rap art exhibition in 798)” This line of lyrics also uses the imperfect rhyme, but the rhyme is mix with Chinese and English. This is different from other lines. 理油发(Have an Oil haircut) 哥们周润发(I’m <a href="javascript:;">Chow</a> <a href="javascript:;">Yun-Fat</a>) 我的Flow很炸让你头很大(My Flow very hype, it makes your head big) 左手Haagen Dazs 右手芬达(Left hand Haagen Dazs right-hand Fender) 我把冰摩卡当瘦身茶(I think of ice mocha as a slimming tea). This lyric shows the Chinese imperfect three syllables rhyme. And it is also internal rhyme which means rhyme in the sentence. AR makes some really good rhyme. What he is doing in the song is always about his skill is so good. Here is another example of AR, the song is called 十(pronunciation in Chinese: shi). AR makes the shi in background music. So, AR uses the same rhyme shi for every end of the sentence in a paragraph. The paragraph is talking about AR’s hustle life. Some rappers will make a rhyme with no meaning of them. AR shows how to make the right way to make the rhyme in the song. Some rappers can’t do the same thing like that. AR shows a different style of rhyme. He uses lots of rhetoric to expand on the topic. It is easy to make rhyme in the lyrics, but it is not easy to make rhymes with the theme.</p>
<p><img src="https://noahwang.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/ARABC.png" alt="AB"></p>
<h2 id="Wordplay"><a href="#Wordplay" class="headerlink" title="Wordplay"></a>Wordplay</h2><p>​    Wordplay is the most heavily utilized ability in a rapper’s arsenal. Most of the time, when you hear an “ooh-oh-oh” from the crowd, it’s because of the clever and sophisticated use of wordplay. All rappers need to learn how to use wordplay effectively, as many rap styles rely on wordplay to sway the crowd in the right direction. Combat rappers use wordplay to refer to their opponents and always get a reaction from the audience. </p>
<p>Because of the different languages, the use of wordplay is also different. Take AR’s 《回家 way back》(Go home way back)as an example. AR is particularly subtle in comparing Hip Hop to his beloved girl. Because lots of people don’t understand the Hip Hop culture in China. The girl is lost. AR stands out and wants to take her back. In the lyrics of “给这笔上了枷锁，我也还是毕加索”(I’m still Picasso even if I’m shackled to this). Here is a really good wordplay in Chinese. “笔”(bi) is the pen. “枷锁”(jiasuo) is lock and chain. “毕加索”(bijiasuo) is the famous painter Picasso. It means although my pen has a lock and chain, I’m still a Picasso-level creator. And the pronunciation is also the same at the same time. Because of the strict regulation of Chinese Hip Hop, lots of rappers say they can’t do their best. It is just an excuse to cover their awful rap skill and blame all the things on regulation. But in the AR’s lyrics, it says that even though there is a regulation on Hip Hop, I can still do very well, like Picasso by using rhetoric. I can still show my skill in Hip Hop. </p>

<p>Another example in AR’s 《回家 way back》is more clever. “没有心上的音，你写不出意”(No music on your heart, you can’t write out the meaning.) “意” means meaning. “心” means heart. “音” means music. These lyrics mean if you don’t pay attention to your music, you can’t have a deep meaning in your song. But the most interesting part is the Chinese character. If you put “音” over “心”, you get a “意”. So, this also means if there is no “音” part, you can’t have the character “意”. I think this is beyond the “wordplay”. AR is trying to do a “character play”. Hip Hop is a foreign culture in China. AR makes some different Hip Hop only in China. This kind of technique is used in a Chinese poem. “何处合成愁，离人心上秋” from Wu Wenying. It means where to get worried, autumn in the people’s hearts. “秋”(autumn) and “心”(heart) are components of “愁”(worry). Autumn in ancient China is a sad season. Lots of famous poems are from autumn. So, if the poet’s heart is going to be autumn, there is worry. In the Chinese Hip Hop podcast The Park(Wes Chen, 2020), the host, Wes Chen, talks with AR about himself. AR mentioned he will read 《唐诗宋词三百首》(A Chinese poem collection). That’s why AR has a very ingenious lyrics set. </p>

<p>Not only pure Chinese wordplay but also the English and Chinese mixed wordplay. In the iPhone Freestyle, there is a lyric “Mic check 1212, 因为我数一数二”(Mic check 1212 because I’m the best) There are many rappers will say Mic check 1212 to check the microphone and be ready to start. In the AR’s lyrics, “数一数二” means the top. But the component of the 4 characters word means count one and count two. So, it is the Chinese for check 1212. AR uses the signature start for rappers in English, and he uses the Chinese translation of check 1212 and tells everyone I’m the best at the same time.</p>

<p>So, according to the analysis of the wordplay of AR, we can see AR make Chinese Hip Hop special, it is not just rapped in Chinese. AR changes the core of Hip Hop with Chinese. AR’s wordplay delight lots of Chinese rappers in how to a good wordplay in Chinese. More and more Chinese rapper is learning how to make wordplay or punchline in the lyrics. It can help their lyrics has a deep meaning.</p>
<h2 id="Criticism-of-Chinese-Hip-Hop"><a href="#Criticism-of-Chinese-Hip-Hop" class="headerlink" title="Criticism of Chinese Hip Hop"></a>Criticism of Chinese Hip Hop</h2><p>In 2017, the biggest Chinese Hip Hop show The Rap of China is known to everyone. Lots of new Hip Hop fans want to dive into this culture. As the principle in the Chinese Hip Hop circle, AR points out lots of bad points in Chinese Hip Hop and The Rap of China. Because rhyme is a famous part of Hip Hop music, in the show The Rap of China, the producer highlight the rhyme in the rapper’s lyrics. New Hip Hop fans notice this thing and think this is the most important thing in Hip Hop. So AR uses a song, 《押韵歌》 (Rhyme song), to tell everyone Hip Hop is not just rhymed.</p>
<p><img src="https://noahwang.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/ARcritic.png" alt="AR critic"></p>
<p>For the hook part, “当他说那 rap is just all about a lot of rhyme,  没人想要听真正好的punchline.” This means when somebody says rap is just all about a lot of rhyme, nobody wants to listen to the real good punchline. AR use these lyrics to uncover the really bad condition in Chinese Hip Hop. Many rappers just make a fancy rhyme to attract more Hip Hop fans to earn money. “如果技巧多好纯粹就看你有多少押，那让我快速教你16押。那就是啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊.”( If the skill is much better purely depends on how many rhymes you have, then let me quickly teach you 16 rhymes. It is Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa). So, this is the most special part of the song of “押韵歌”. AR said: Ok if you just want a rhyme, I give you a 16-syllable rhyme. He uses 16 onomatopoeia Chinese characters to make the rhyme. It has no meaning at all. So, AR uses his way to ironic criticize the people who only listen to how many rhymes you have. It’s not only in Chinese Hip Hop but in America. The song 《Gucci gang》 from Lil pump as well. The hook is always repeated Gucci gang. It has no meaning but just rhymes.</p>
<p>AR also disagree with the idea of The Rap of China. He said he will never go to the show. AR think the show is like the movie 《Battle Royale》. Every rapper needs to be judged on your destination by the show or the capital. The director was exposed saying the show only wants more views. They don’t pay attention to Hip Hop music culture. So, AR doesn’t like the show The Rap of China. Conversely, somebody knows AR joined another TV show on 2016 called China Best Songs. AR explained in an interview SoulSense TWH. AR said the main difference between these two shows is. China Best Songs will help you to make better music. But The Rap of China will judge you by one song and if you pass you will have more commercials to go with if you don’t pass you have nothing. You can’t learn anything from the show.</p>
<p>Although AR said he never go to the show The Rap of China, he joined the show China Best Songs in 2016. In the interview with Tuzi(2020), AR responded to this viewpoint of him. He said the point is not joining the show, the point is how’s the show. The Rap of China has an in visible hand in choosing rappers’ life. He also mentioned another show of Bilibili which is called the Rap New Generation. The reason why that show is more interesting is that people will not tell who’s music is better than who’s bad. This show can give rappers a way to say what is Hip Hop, rather than the show saying who is good or bad. Rap New generation gives rappers the right to choose to say who is good or bad.</p>
<p>AR uses his experience and song to tell the listeners and rappers what is good for them and what is bad. It is very grateful for people to have these people to remind you don’t forget their roots. AR leads more and more new rappers to make their way right.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>AR shows his attitude toward Chinese Hip Hop culture through his music and interview. There are lots of rappers who are influenced right now. Famous Chinese rapper Air said AR is Hip Hop itself. AR is known as the “Chinese Wordplay King”. Because there are many music AR use wordplay, more and more rappers are trying to use wordplay in their music to seek deep meaning. Every Chinese rapper call AR the principle. AR is like the teacher to leading other Chinese rappers on the lyrics and the right direction of Chinese Hip Hop in the future.</p>
